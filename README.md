This is the front end for my Ski Pass Snow Compare project. The project compares upcoming snowfall between ski resorts on the IKON and Epic mega passes.

This project was built with:

- NextJS / React
- Typescript
- Material UI

Thank you to Red Stapler for the great tutorial on making a snow effect background.

Thank you to Steve Schoger @ HeroPatterns for the excellent background pattern for the mobile footer.
